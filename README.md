## Requirements
For development, you will only need Node.js installed on your environement. Only visually tested on latest version of Chrome and Firefox

### Yarn
Recommended to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) rather than npm as all instructions will be written with yarn.

### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure below.

    $ node --version
    v10.13.0

    $ npm --version
    6.4.1

---
## Install

    $ yarn

## Run locally

    $ yarn dev

This will run a server on `localhost:1234` and populate a folder called `dist` in the root of the folder. Any changes you make the files will be rebuilt

## Build for production

@TODO

## Tests

To run the tests

    $ yarn test
